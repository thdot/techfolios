 In this paper, we report on a corresponding large-scale measurement study covering an urban area of 200 km 2 over a period of 230 days using sensors deployed on garbage trucks, resulting in more than 112 thousand high-quality samples for received packet power. Using this data, we compare eleven previously proposed path loss models and additionally provide new coefficients for the Log-distance model. Our results reveal that the Log-distance model and other well-known empirical models such as Okumura or Winner+ provide reasonable estimations in an urban environment, and terrain based models such as ITM or ITWOM have no advantages.
